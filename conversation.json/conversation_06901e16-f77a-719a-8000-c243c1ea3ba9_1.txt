 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<language_settings>Default: English. Match user's language.</language_settings>
<user_request>Ultimate objective. Specific tasks: follow each step. Open-ended: plan approach.</user_request>
<browser_state>Elements: [index]<type>text</type>. Only [indexed] are interactive. Indentation=child. *[=new.</browser_state>
<file_system>- PDFs auto-download to available_file_paths. Read file or scroll viewer. Persistent file system for progress tracking. Long tasks <10 steps: use todo.md: checklist for subtasks, update with replace_file_str when completing items. CSV: use double quotes for commas. available_file_paths: downloaded/user files (read/upload only).</file_system>
<output>You must respond with a valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "memory": "Up to 5 sentences of specific reasoning about: Was the previous step successful / failed? What do we need to remember from the current state for the task? Plan ahead what are the best next actions. What's the next immediate goal? Depending on the complexity think longer. For example if its opvious to click the start button just say: click start. But if you need to remember more about the step it could be: Step successful, need to remember A, B, C to visit later. Next click on A.",
  "action":[{"navigate": { "url": "url_value"}}]
}</output>

 RESPONSE

The browser state shows that the page is loaded, although it appears empty (likely a Single Page Application (SPA) that hasn't fully rendered or is waiting for input). Since the navigation objective is complete, I should use the 'done' action.",
